        <div class="job-period">Nov 2021 - Present</div>
        <div>Key Skills - Python, SQL, Linux, Azure, Docker.</div>
        <p>My primary responsibility is managing data in a CRM system, which includes information about companies, contacts, services, and sales. This involves supervising a team of data entry assistants and building no-code automation workflows. I map the CRM in Notion and Miro to track active processes. I have implemented exception-catching at critical actions in workflows which send email-alerts with context if a workflow fails to perform as expected.</p>
        <p>Accomplishments:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Built a network of automated workflows that increased efficiency and improved data quality due to reduced manual input and risk of human-error.</li>
            <li>Automated much of the sales process for existing-client certification renewals.</li>
            <li>Scraped large amounts (20,000+) of high-value, publicly available data.</li>
            <li>Performed analysis of sales using Python which informed company-wide financial forecasts and sales targets.</li>

        <div class="job-title">Web App - Army Builder</div>
        <p>This project is inspired by one of my hobbies, tabletop wargaming, and is a web app used to query data on models. The project is written in Python using the web framework 'FastAPI' to handle queries, and it connects to a MongoDB NoSQL database (which was preferred to SQL as each model has numerous nested stat-blocks). It is hosted on the Railway infrastructure platform, and was completed as part of the #100DaysOfCode challenge.</p>
